# Web Scrapping Project
## List of European Stadiums by Capacity

In this project I attempted to learn web scrapping by looking into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_stadiums_by_capacity. By running the scrape_stadiums.py file you
get all the info in the wiki page into a nice csv. In order to the function to run correctly you should write the table name when prompted like:
 - *table_1* if you want the over 80k table.
 - *table_2* " " " " " 70-80k ".
 - *table_3* " " " " " 60-70k ".
 - *table_4* " " " " " 50-60k ".
 - *table_5* " " " " " 40-50k ".
 - *table_6* " " " " " 30-40k ".
 - *table_7* " " " " " 25-30k ".
 
 ### Known bugs.
 Some info in the tables is not yet parsed correctly, so some special characters are showing wrongly and some reference numbers and brackets (i.e. [2]) are also appearing.
